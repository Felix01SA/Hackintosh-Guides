## Prerequisites

1. Time and patience.
   - Don't start working on this if you have deadlines or important work. Hackintoshes are not something you should be relying on as a work machine.
2. Know your hardware.
   - Your CPU name and its generation.
   - Your GPU
   - Your storage device (HDD/SSD, NVMe/AHCI/RAID/IDE configuration)
   - your laptop/desktop model if from an OEM
   - Your **Ethernet chipset**
   - Your WLAN/Bluetooth chipset
3. A basic knowledge of command lines and how to use terminal/command prompt.
   - This is not crucial, this is the basis of this whole guide. We can't help you if you don't know to `cd` to a directory or delete a file.
4. A machine that is compatible as seen in the [compatibility](/guides/hardware-limitations) section.
5. A minimum of:
   - 16GB USB if you're going to use macOS to create the USB installer.
   - 4GB USB if you're going to use Windows or Linux for creating the USB installer.
6. An **Ethernet connection** and you must know your LAN card's model

   <Callout type="warn">
     No WIFI dongles, Ethernet USB adapter work depending on macOS support.
   </Callout>
   - You must either have a physical Ethernet port, or a compatible mcaOS Ethernet
   dongle/adapter. In case you have a [compatible WIFI card]() {/*TODO: Add link*/}
   , you can also use that.
   <Callout>
     Note the majotiry of WIFI cards are not supported by macOS.
   </Callout>

   - For people who can't use Ethernet but have an Android phone, you
     can connect your Android phone to WIFI and then tether it using USB with
     [HoRNDIS](https://joshuawise.com/horndis#available_versions).

7. **Proper OS Installation**
   - Be it:
     - macOS (a fairly recent one would be better)
     - Windows (Windows 10. 1703 or newer)
     - Linux (Clean and properly functioning, with Python 2.7 or later)
   - For Windows and Linux users, **15GB** of free space on the drive you're working on. On Windows, your OS disk (C:) must have at least **15GB** of free space.
   - For macOS users, **30GB** if free spcae on system's drive.
   - Most tools used in this guide will also require [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
8. Latest **BIOS** installed
   - In most cases, updation your Bios will provide the best support of macOS
   - The exception to this are `MSI 500-series` AMD motherboards, read more at [Motherboard Support](/guides/hardware-limitations#motherboard-support).
