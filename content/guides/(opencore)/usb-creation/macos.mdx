While you don't need a fresh install of macOS to use OpenCore, some users prefer having a fresh slate with their boot manager upgrades.

To start we'll want to grab ourselves a copy of macOS. You can skip this and head to formatting the USB if you're just making a bootable OpenCore stick and not an installer. For everyone else, you can either download macOS from the App Store or with Munki's script.

## Downloading macOS: Modern OS [#downloading-macos-modern]

this method allows you to download macOS 10.13 and newer, for 10.12 and older see [Downloading macOS: Legacy OS](#downloading-macos-legacy).

<Callout title='macOS 12 and above note'>
As recent macOS versions introduce changes to the USB stack, its highly advisable that you USB ports (with USBToolBox) before installing macOS.
  <Callout type='warn'>
    With macOS 11.3 and newer, [XhciPortLimit is broken resulting in boot loops](https://github.com/dortania/bugtracker/issues/162). \
    If you've already [mapped your USB ports](){/*TODO: Add link*/} and disabled `XhciPortLimit`, you can boot macOS 11.3+ without issues.

  </Callout>
</Callout>

From a macOS machine that meets the requirements of the OS version you want ro install, go directly to the App Store:

- [Using Apple Store](#using-app-store)

For machines that need a specific OS releases or can't download from the App Store:

- [Command Line Software Update utility](#command-line-software-update-utility)
- [Munki's InstallInstallMacOS utility](#installinstallmacos-utility)

### Using App Store [#using-app-store]

From a macOS machine that meets the requirements of the OS version you want to install, go directly to the App Store and download the desired OS release and continue to [Setting up the installer](#setting-installer)

### Command Line Software Update Utility [#command-line-software-update-utility]

Open a terminal window then copy and paste the below command:

```sh title="Terminal"
softwareupdate --list-full-installers; echo; echo "Please enter version number you wish to download:"; read REPLY; [ -n "$REPLY" ] && softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version "$REPLY"
```

![Command Line Software Update Utility](/usb-creation/creating-usb/commandline.macos.png)

This giver you a list of available releases you can choose from. Once downloaded it will be saved in your Applications folder. You can continue to [Setting up the installer](#setting-installer).

### Munki's InstallInstallMacOS utility [#installinstallmacos-utility]

<Callout title='Note for users running macOS Monterey 12.3 or above'>
  Starting from macOS Monterey 12.3, Apple removed support for `python2.7`, so without `installinstallmacos.py` will throw the following error:

```plaintext
This tool requires the Python xattr module. Perhaps run 'pip install xattr' to install it.
```

To overcome the issue, we recommend to install `Command Line Tools for Xcode` by running `xcode-select --install{:sh}` in the Terminal and then run `pip3 install xattr{:sh}`

After that you can run the same command below but with `python3` instead of just `python`:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/macOS-installer && cd ~/macOS-installer && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/munki/macadmin-scripts/main/installinstallmacos.py > installinstallmacos.py && sudo python3 installinstallmacos.py
```

</Callout>

In order to run it, just copy and paste the below command in a terminal window:

```sh title="Terminal"
mkdir -p ~/macOS-installer && cd ~/macOS-installer && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/munki/macadmin-scripts/main/installinstallmacos.py > installinstallmacos.py && sudo python installinstallmacos.py
```

![Munki's InstallInstallMacOS utility](/usb-creation/creating-usb/munki.macos.png)

As you can see, we get a nice list of macOS installers. If you need a particular versions of macOS, you can select it by typing the number next to it. For this example we'll choose 10:

![Munki's InstallInstallMacOS utility - process](/usb-creation/creating-usb/munki-process.macos.png)

This is going to take a while as we're downloading the entire 8GB+ macOS installer, so it's highly recommended to read the rest of the guide while you wait.

Once finished, you'll find in your `~/macOS-installer/` folder a DMG containing the macOS Installer, called `Install_macOS_<version>.dmg`. Mount it and you'll find the installer application.

<Callout>
  We recommended to remove the install macOS.app into the `/Applications`
  folder, as we'll be executing commands from there.
</Callout>
<Callout>
  Running `Cmd+Shift+G` in Finder will allow you to easily jump to
  `~/macOS-installer`
</Callout>

![Munki's InstallInstallMacOS utility - dmg](/usb-creation/creating-usb/munki-dmg.macos.png)

From here, jump tp [Setting up the installer](#setting-installer) to finish your work. If you want to check the integrity of your download, you can check [this repository of checksums](https://github.com/notpeter/apple-installer-checksums), although do note that these are crowdsourced checksums and may not be a reliable way to check for authenticity.

## Downloading macOS: Legacy OS [#downloading-macos-legacy]

This method allows you to download much older version of OS X, currently supporting all Intel versions of OS X (10.4 to current).

- [Legacy macOS: Offline Method](/guides/usb-creation/legacy-macos/legacy-macos-offline)
  - 10.7 - 10.12 supported, excluding 10.9
- [Legacy macOS: Online Method](/guides/usb-creation/legacy-macos/legacy-macos-online)
  - 10.7 - 11 supported
- [Legacy macOS: Disk Images](/guides/usb-creation/legacy-macos/legacy-macos-disk)
  - 10.4 - 10.6 supported

## Setting ip the installer [#setting-installer]

Now we'll be formatting the USB to prep for both the macOS installer and OpenCore. We'll want to use macOS Extended (HFS+) with a GUID partition map. This will create two partitions: the main `MyVolume` and a second called `EFI` which is used as a boot partition where your firmware will check for boot files.

<Callout>
  The `EFI` partition created by formatting the USB is hidden until tou mount
  it. This will mounted later when [Setting up OpenCore's EFI
  environment](#setting-oc-env)
</Callout>
<Callout>
  By default, Disk Utility only shows partitions - press `Cmd/Win+2` to show all
  devices (alternatively you can press the View button)
</Callout>
<Callout>
  Users following [Legacy macOS: Online
  Method]('/guides/usb-creation/legacy-macos/legacy-mecos-online) section can
  skip to [Setting up OpenCore's EFI environment](#setting-oc-env)
</Callout>

![Disk Utility - Erase Disk](/usb-creation/creating-usb/erase-disk.macos.png)

Next run the `createinstallmedia` command provided by [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372):

<Callout>
  That the command is made for USB's formatted with the name `MyVolume`
</Callout>

```sh title="Terminal"
# replace <version> with the macOS version
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ <version>.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
```

<Callout title='Note for users on Apple Silicon installing macOS older than Big Sur (11.x)'>
If the `createinstallmedia` fails with `zsh: killed` or `Killed: 9` then it's most likely an issue with the installer's code signature. To fix this, you can run the following command:

```sh
# replace <version> with the macOS version
cd /Applications/Install\ macOS\ <version>.app/Contents/Resources/
codesign -s - -f --deep /Applications/Install\ macOS\ <version>.app
```

You will need the command line tools for Xcode installed:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

</Callout>

This will take some time so you may want to grab a coffee or continue reading the guide (to be fair you really shouldn't be following this guide step by step without reading the whole thing first).

You can also replace the `createinstallmedia` path with that of where your installer's located (same idea with the drive name).

### Legacy Setup [#legacy-setup]

For systems not supporting UEFI boot, see below:

To start, you need the following:

- `BootInstall_IA32.tool` or `BootInstall_X64.tool`
  <Callout>
    This can be found in OpenCorePkg under `/Utilities/LegacyBoot/`
  </Callout>
- Install USB (created above)

Within your OpenCore build folder, navigate to `Utilities/LegacyBoot`. Here you'll find a file called `BootInstall_<arch>.tool`. What this does is install DuetPkg to your desired drive.

![BootInstall.tool](/usb-creation/creating-usb/legacy-setup-bootinstall.macos.png)

Now run this tool in terminal with sudo(This tool will likely fail otherwise):

```sh title="Terminal"
# Replace <arch> with the architecture of your CPU: X64 or IA32
sudo ~/Downloads/OpenCore/Utilities/legacyBoot/BootInstall_<arch>.tool
```

![BootInstall.tool - process](/usb-creation/creating-usb/legacy-setup-boot-disk.macos.png)

This will give you a list of available disks, choose yours and you will be prompted to write a new MBR. Choose yes`[y]` and you'll be finished.

![BootInstall.tool - done](/usb-creation/creating-usb/legacy-setup-boot-done.macos.png)
![BootInstall.tool - efi](/usb-creation/creating-usb/legacy-setup-efi-base.macos.png)

## Setting up OpenCore's EFI environment [#setting-oc-env]

Setting up OpenCore's EFI environment is simple â€“ all you need to do is mount our EFI system partition. This is automatically made when we format with GUID but is unmounted by default, this is where our friend [MountEFI](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI) comes in:

![MountEFI](/usb-creation/creating-usb/oc-env-mount-efi-usb.macos.png)

You'll notice that once we open the EFI partition, it's empty. This is where the fun begins.
