## Requirements

- [OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases), highly recommended running the debug version to show more info.
- [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) to edit `.plist` files (OpenCore Configurator is another tool but is heavily outdated and the Mackie version is known for corruption. **Please avoid these kinds of tools at all costs!**).
- You must remove Clover from your system entirely if you wish to use OpenCore as your main bootloader. Keep a backup of clover based EFI. See here on what needs to be cleaned: [Clover Conversion](){/* TODO: Add link */}

## Online vs Offline Installer [#online-vs-offline-installer]

Offline installer have a complete copy of macOS, while online installers are only recovery image (~500MB) which then download macOS from Apple servers once booted.

- Offline
  - Can only be made in macOS.
  - Windows/Linux do not have the APFS/HFS drivers needed to assemble a full installer.
- Online
  - Can be made in macOS/Linux/Windows.
  - Requires a working internet connection cia a macOS supported network adapter on the target machine.
